# COVID-19 - Brazilian States
Data, analysis and graphs of the advancement of COVID-19 in Brazil

## Description

The datasets in this repository were generated thanks to the joint effort of researchers and students of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and researchers of the University of Brasília (UnB).

Our methodology consisted of dividing the country into regions and states and looking for sources of information regarding confirmed cases of COVID-19 in that region. This procedure was necessary because we realized that the numbers provided by the  Ministry of Health in Brazil, for some regions, were outdated or discrepant.

The confirmed and death numbers are updated daily. Data is mined by one person and verified by a different one in official communication channels but also in media.

Since March, 19th 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Health is not sharing any CSV file or any other dataset format that researchers could use to process the data. This is the reason that we decided to generate our own dataset.
